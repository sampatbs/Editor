The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously from different devices or browser tabs. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how real-time communication, data persistence, and multi-user collaboration can be achieved using modern web technologies.
