The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously from different devices or browser tabs. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how real-time communication, data persistence, and multi-user collaboration can be achieved using modern web technologies.

This project is built using the MERN stack, which includes React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for database storage. Socket.IO is used to enable real-time communication between users.
